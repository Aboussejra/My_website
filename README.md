# My First Website
A presentation website, was done while being on Master 1 to learn basic of Web Development and Python Backend with Flask, 2 of my Machine Learning models I did for fun are available and usable there. It is deployed on Heroku and may be found here:

You may do :
- Getting an Anime Recommendation on https://amir-boussejra-website.herokuapp.com/Anime_rec (Using Collaborative Filtering on https://myanimelist.net/ DB)
- See How heavy you should lift on Powerlifting exercices https://amir-boussejra-website.herokuapp.com/HHSUL (Based on https://www.openpowerlifting.org DB)

I was young on doing this website. The project is not that clean now that I have more experience on Pure development working on real life projects for Companies. Yet it shows some of my past work and how I love Animes and Powerlifting so I keep it here for fun :).
